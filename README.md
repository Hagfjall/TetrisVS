TetrisVS
========

A project made by four students in the course EDA095, network programming @ Lund University. 

Made a server/client solution for a 1VS1 Tetris game. Are some known bugs when the a user moves/rotate the shape in some special cases but since the course had focus on the network part we didn't spend any time on fixing the bug.
